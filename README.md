harp
====

This is the soft (arduino and pc-side) for the laser harp i made for the "soir√©e MiNET : h### me I'm famous" 07/12/12.

Originally based on tty-midi(GPL) for the pc-side.
UART libs are from lib-nfc(LGPL).

Because a significant part of the code was made in a hurry on a pc that wasn't mine it is not always very clean (dirty commit, code duplication) but it works !
